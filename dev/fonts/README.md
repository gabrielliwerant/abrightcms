# A Bright CMS Development Folder

Don't include this folder in your production environment. This is the place 
where we store non-production classes used for debuging, testing, or bulding
production aspects like CSS from LESS code.

We also use this as a place to store and modify js, CSS, and any images in 
a development state, where they are fully separated and expanded for debugging
and working.

We may also need different JSON or XML files to load data in development, so we
store those here and use for testing in development mode.

## Requirements

* PHP 5 >= 5.2, PHP 5.3 recommended
