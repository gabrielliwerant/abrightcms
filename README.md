# A Bright CMS

A lightweight website and web application framework and content management 
system in PHP. It uses an MVC pattern in which the model and view are completely 
decoupled and require the controller to mediate between them.

Content is stored in JSON or XML files and websites are built through the use of
these files and custom methods which retrieve and display that data.
